# ManyShields
Adds a variety of shields to Minecraft.

Currently includes wood, stone, copper, gold, diamond, and netherite shields, all of which function like normal shields with increased/decreased durability
and the special abilities of their item counterparts (gold enchants better, netherite doesn't burn in lava, etc)

Will eventually include:

- Glass Shield - a shield that breaks after one hit, but will deal massive damage to whatever broke it
- Amethyst Shield - a shield that has low durability but high enchantability, plus the bonus of nice melodic tones when hit
- Netherrack Shield - a shield that has low durability but is easy to make
- Explosive Shield - a shield made with TNT that will explode when hit, injuring both the attacker and the defender
- Bone Shield - a shield that, when held, will make skeletons passive
- Unbreakable Shield - a very expensive shield that is unbreakable, for late-game when you can't be bothered to keep crafting shields.

feel free to use in your modpack or whatever, just please send me the modpack link when it's out so I can play it, thanks
